# **percent-age**
## a simple js script website to display the current date as a percentage.


**to do:**

- make an animation for when it hits the new year
- ~get custom font~
- slow down inital animation and add ease
- make colour picker sidebar to change theme

maybe:
- ~add lots of decimal points so you can see it update in real time~
- add counter of how many people on the website
- add other stats like days passed, hours passed, seconds passed, etc.
